# 🚀 Snahp Auto Base64 Decode

This is a user script that automatically decodes Base64-encoded strings found in the post content of Snahp forum threads. It replaces the encoded strings with their decoded versions, and also converts certain keys to clickable links. The script runs on the Snahp forum thread pages and modifies the post content dynamically.

This project is a fork of [Bilibox's Snahp Auto Base64 Decode](https://github.com/Bilibox/Snahp-Auto-Base64-Decode). All credit for the original idea and implementation goes to Bilibox.
